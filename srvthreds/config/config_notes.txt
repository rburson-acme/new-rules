Configuration Notes

This config directory is intended to hold all configuration for all services, and is maintained in source control.
The contents of this directory's docker directory should be copied directly to the .docker/config directly when changes are made.

Currently using cerbot to produce (and automatically renew) a free ssl cert for proximl.com
Nginx gets configured to use the cert
