# Scaling and redundancy

    - Set up sentinel or clustering for Redis
    - Setup clustering for RabbitMQ
    - Consider switchin Q to https://docs.bullmq.io/
    - Setup "connection state recovery" and an "Adapter" SocketIO
    - Setup https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js for SocketIO
    - Set up scaling for Session service, Engine, and Agents
    - Change server to fastify
    - Setup clustering for DB
    - Convert to ESM

# Todo Next!

    - Look at possibly pluging in code in Transformer for very complex tasks
    - Continue with routing demo
    - Finsish 'persistence_agent.test.ts' with PersistenceAgent.ts, using format this defined in 'store_obj.pattern.json'
    - create a 'unified' test to test 'store_obj.pattern.json' and other storage operations
    - enhance eventManager class to collate events more easily to 'wait for' particular response (this will be useful on server and client)


# Reminders

    - Jsonata can be upgraded for improved performance but has had and API changes to be asyncronous which will require
    - Some consideration before adding
